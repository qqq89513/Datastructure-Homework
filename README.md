1. From the PDF: Consider a complex number system(ie. *x+iy*). For complex number data sets, create a user-friendly, menu-driven program that implements a doubly **linked list**, including the following operations. Please discuss the complexity for each operation.  
  - (a) Build a list by reading a sequence of complex numbers from input.  
  - (b) Determine if a list is empty.  
  - (c) Search for a complex number.  
  - (d)  Search for a complex number.  
  - (e)  Delete a complex number.  
  - (f)  Print out a list.  
  - (g)  Count the numberof times a given complex number occurs in a list.  
  - (h)  Find the middle element of a list.(If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle numbers.)
